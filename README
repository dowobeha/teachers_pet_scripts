Helper scripts for managing assignments using Github
----------------------------------------------------

1) Install teachers_pet
2) Clone this repository
3) Modify the files in .teachers_pet to use your Github username and password
4) Optionally, put the files in .teachers_pet/bin in your PATH

Now, for each class:

1) For each class, create a directory, following the layout provided in the example directory in Homework
2) Within that directory, modify the files so that the students' Github usernames are in the file "students"
3) Within that directory, modify the file .ORGANIZATION.private_script using your class's Github organization


Next, within the class directory, create a directory for each homework assignment. Make each directory a git repo, and populate it with the files required for the assignment.

Next:
1) create_repos NAME_OF_HW_DIR
2) create_student_teams NAME_OF_HW_DIR
3) push_files NAME_OF_HW_DIR
